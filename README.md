# C_Socket_Assignment
This is the answer to a CAT we were given for our Network Programming class. Code for setting up the sockets  I got from the lecture's notes.
Only works on a linux system

Compile and run with the following commands on the terminal. (Navigate to the project folder)
   #Server
   compile-    gcc -o server server.c 
   run - ./server
   
   #Client
   compile-    gcc -o client client.c 
   run- ./clent
   
 Thank you
